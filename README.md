# Arch Package Build

A collection of packages and scripts used for easy system install/maintenance.

This collection of packages is tuned to my specific system, and will overwrite anything already installed
on an existing system.

## Installation

1. Boot into a new Arch Linux install, and type `curl -sL https://git.io/coul-install | bash`
2. Fill in the details for the system being installed.
