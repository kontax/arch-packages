1. Install.sh
  > Install full system - no personal files
  > Chroot + clone dotfiles
  > Environment variable outlining system (in /etc/profile.d probably)
  > All files that can be standardised should be (ie. /etc/i3 rather than ~/.config/i3)

2. Setup
  > Different script for each system config
  > Setup links personal files + system-wide secret files
  > Files copies or links between different systems? Eg. gnupg.conf desktop == base
  > Setup should install system within script - should work in exising system
